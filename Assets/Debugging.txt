All the conclusions in this "investigation" are based on the profiler data from builds

Frequently dispatching the shader is not the cause
(removing Dispatch() enteirly from the code doesn't get rid of the issue)

Is continously reading the data back from the shader causing the problem?
Yes. (commenting the lines 27-32 in Test.cs cause the lag spikes to disappear)

Wil the lag appear if we instead disconnect the buffer from the compute shader?
No

IMPORTANT: Timeline view shows that Gfx.UpdateAsyncReadbackData causes the lag
